Flexy - Your AI-Powered Personal Trainer
This is a Next.js project that demonstrates how to build a modern, full-stack web application acting as a smart, conversational fitness coach. Its mission is to eliminate ‚Äúdecision paralysis‚Äù by instantly generating personalized workout plans.

API Routes in Next.js: Demonstrates building backend endpoints to communicate with external services (like an AI API).

Visual Exercise Guide: Each exercise includes instructions and a visual demonstration (GIF) for proper execution.

Progress Tracking: A simple, localStorage-based calendar that marks completed workout days.

Modern and Responsive Design: Clean interface built with Tailwind CSS, and a modern font, Geist, automatically optimized with next/font.
