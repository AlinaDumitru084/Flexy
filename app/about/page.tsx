            <p className="leading-relaxed mb-4">
              Our mission is to inspire you to flex your limits, to prove to yourself that you can do more than you ever thought possible. We believe fitness shouldn’t be about perfection — it should be about progress, self-discovery, and feeling strong in your own skin.
            </p>
            <p className="leading-relaxed">
              We turn complex fitness ideas into small, doable steps you can actually stick to. And we do it with compassion, encouragement, and zero judgment. Because you don’t need to be perfect — you just need to keep going.
